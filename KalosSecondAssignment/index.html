        Hello everyone that is visiting this website reading this. The purpose of this website is to show who I am and to promote my personal brand. I am currently a senior college student about to graduate college with a bachelor of science of computer science from Stony Brook University. Over the past 4 years I have worked on many projects involving software and programming that I am very proud of. Listed on this website are examples of my many projects that I am proud as well as my achievements that made I during my high school career.  There are also highlights of my interests such as gaming, traveling, and going to the gym! I realized that making a website an important part of getting ahead in one's career by promoting themselves so I saw it as a necessity to get this website set up to show all the things I've accomplished and am proud to show about myself.
