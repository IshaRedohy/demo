        <p class = "writing">I grew up in Forest Hills, NY, a residential neighborhood situated within the borough of Queens in New York City. Growing up my mother was an elementary school teacher and my father was a painter and contractor and I grew up as an only child.  My fascination with computers and software engineering first started when I was young boy playing video games on my Playstation 3. I thought that it was amazing that I could experience virtual worlds with immersive stories that engaged me more so than books or movies, and I wanted to be a part of that. Since I was 10 years old I wanted to design and make video games and at the very least be a part of the tech field. I realized that technology and computer science felt like the most relevant subject for me to grow in this innovative technological world in the 21st century.
            When I first arrived at Stony Brook University in 2017 I did not know how to code one bit, however I pushed myself to learn so I could have opportunities as an engineer in the future. My primary interests in computer science include but are not limited to computer security, game programming, app development, and operating systems. I'm open to collaborating and gaining experience in any sort of software engineering field such as front end, back end, full stack, or systems. My interests outside of school include video games, anime, traveling, and all sorts of different forms of music. </p>
