        <div>
            <p>Over the past few years I've done a lot to try to grow as a developer outside of school. I'm currently attending UMGC as a Computer Science major. A couple years ago I completed a Web Development bootcamp 
                through Udemy, but quickly learned that I needed to know much more before I could make a passable website. The next few months I spent learning 
                ghraphic design and cleaned up the projects I'd started in the bootcamp, as well as started several of my own.
            </p>
            <p>Take a look at a few of my projects below ~</p>

            <h2>Finding Farmers</h2>
            <img src="./imgs/site_FindingFarmers.png" alt="Finding Farmers" style="height: 300px;">
            <p style="width: 500px;">Finding Farmers is a website that can help finding nearby Farmers Markets. We
                make use of location services by default, but also have a search function that allows users to look
                for markets anywhere in the United States! A Contact Us page to available to get in touch with the
                developers as well.</p>

            <h2>Yelp Camp</h2>
            <img src="./imgs/site_YelpCamp.png" alt="Yelp Camp" style="height: 300px;">
            <p style="width: 500px;">Yelp Camp is essentially a Yelp-clone, but for campgrounds. It allows anyone to search
                for and view campgrounds, as well as the comments that have been made on them. Users can add their
                own campgrounds and comments after they register and sign-in. This is my most in depth project, 
                in terms of the backend functionality.</p>
