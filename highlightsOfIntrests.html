            <p class="writing">In 2017 I traveled across the United states with my father in a rental car. We went from NYC to LA! It was a very exciting experience that helped expand my worldview. I also have traveled to Canada in 2014 and France in 2015. My next travel destination that I have is England to visit a very close friend in Cambridge!

            <p class ="writing">Another interest that I have is going on hiking trails. Ever since I was little my father would take me to various places around upstate NY to go hiking. Hiking trails I frequent include but are not limited to Bear Mountain, Break Neck Ridge, and Hook Mountain
